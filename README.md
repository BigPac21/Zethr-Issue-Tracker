Zethr Bug Bounty
================

Feel like earning some ETH? We've set aside 5 ETH for the Zethr Platform bug bounty.
We'll get straight to the point: below, we have a description of all of our contracts and their intended purposes. If you manage to find bugs in them, here's what you can earn:

1) 0.5 ETH - CRITICAL: This bug enable stealing of ETH or complete lockdown of the contract / blackholing eth. No bueno.

2) 0.1 ETH - MEDIUM: This bug makes the contract function in an unintended way, or otherwise opens up loopholes that can be exploited, but not to the severity of CRITICAL bugs.

3) 0.025 ETH - NITPICKS: These are "bugs" in that we should probably fix them, but they won't hurt the project too much if we don't. Example: Earlier, in Zethr.sol, we were able to add and remove arbitrary div rates, which we could have used to lock up the project as pointed out by a community member. This isn't great, but it's not MEDIUM or CRITICAL.

Please report these bugs by creating issues. We reserve the right to judge the severity category of the bug. Please post your address in your issue to receive ETH.
