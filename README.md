Zethr Bug Bounty
================

Feel like earning some ETH? We've set aside 5 ETH for the Zethr Platform bug bounty.
We'll get straight to the point: below, we have a description of all of our contracts and their intended purposes. If you manage to find bugs in them, here's what you can earn:

1) 0.5 ETH - CRITICAL: This bug enables stealing of ETH or complete lockdown of the contract / blackholing eth. No bueno.

2) 0.1 ETH - MEDIUM: This bug makes the contract function in an unintended way, or otherwise opens up loopholes that can be exploited, but not to the severity of CRITICAL bugs.

3) 0.025 ETH - NITPICKS: These are "bugs" in that we should probably fix them, but they won't hurt the project too much if we don't. Example: Earlier, in Zethr.sol, we were able to add and remove arbitrary div rates, which we could have used to lock up the project as pointed out by a community member. This isn't great, but it's not MEDIUM or CRITICAL.

Please report these bugs by creating issues. We reserve the right to judge the severity category of the bug. Please post your address in your issue to receive ETH.

## Zethr Main Contract

This is the main Zethr contract, and probably the most prone to bugs. When created, it should not allow any buys or sells. Once the devs (administrators) launch the ICO phase, buys should be allowed, but not sells. Buys are restricted by a password provided by the admins on the main Zethr website (https://zethr.io), but only during the ICO phase.

The regular phase should be triggerable by the administrators, or anyone 2 weeks after the ICO phase has begun.

Once the regular phase begins, buys AND sells should be allowed, with the price increasing in value as more tokens are bought, and decreasing in value as more tokens are sold. Token price should never go below the ICO price.

When buying tokens, people should be restricted to only the dividend rates specified in the contract - 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 33%. When selling tokens, the dividend rate applied should be the average of all the user's buyins.

When transferring tokens, there should be no exploits, and the recipient of the transfer should inherit the average dividend rate of the sender if they have no tokens.
